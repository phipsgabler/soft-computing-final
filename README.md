# Selected Topics in Soft Computing: Final Project

## Data

The `data` folder contains the following three data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

- [Glass identification](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification)
- [Ionosphere](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ionosphere)
- [Image segmentation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/image+segmentation) (Only the training
  set was used.)

(The Pima indians diabetes data set apperantly has been removed due to license restrictions.)

These datasets were retrieved through Jack Dunn's
[`uci-data`](https://github.com/JackDunnNZ/uci-data) script.
